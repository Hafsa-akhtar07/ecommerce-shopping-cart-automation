#E-commerce Shopping Cart Automation – OpenCart
Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement an automated UI testing framework for an e-commerce shopping cart system using Software Quality Engineering (SQE) best practices.
The project focuses on validating the functional correctness, reliability, and quality of critical e-commerce workflows such as user authentication, product selection, cart management, and checkout.

An OpenCart demo application is used as the Application Under Test (AUT).
No application development is performed; instead, the project emphasizes test automation, documentation, reporting, performance testing, security validation, and CI/CD integration.
